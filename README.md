ðŸ§  What I Learned and Challenges Faced
Working on the Baltimore Salary Analysis project significantly deepened my understanding of real-world data analysis using Python. I gained hands-on experience in loading, cleaning, and preprocessing large datasets using Pandas, and developed effective visualizations with Matplotlib and Seaborn to uncover trends and patterns. I learned to identify and handle outliers, missing values, and inconsistent data formats, which are common issues in public datasets.

One of the main challenges I faced was dealing with unclean and inconsistent data, especially in columns related to job titles and salary formats. Additionally, making sense of categorical variables like departments and job titles required thoughtful grouping and aggregation. Another challenge was designing visualizations that clearly conveyed insights without becoming too cluttered or misleading. This project helped me understand the importance of data storytelling and how visual clarity and proper interpretation can make a significant difference in communicating findings.
